When using chatGPT for the first time, go to the official website to create a new account:

It supports most mailboxes for registration.

If you encounter this situation, it means that there are too many active users, just refresh a few times.



After logging in, enter this website to get an API key: https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys

Log in, click "Create New Security Key", Create an API key

The key will only be displayed once, and only once! ! ! Remember to keep it safe! If the key is not saved in time, you will have to regenerate another one! ! The format of the key should be: sk-xxxxxx. It is best to store it somewhere, so that it can be available at any time in the future.

# HowTo Guide

Two input methods:

1. "Hey Siriï¼ŒSiri with chatGPT", will open up the shortcut ('yes' to all permissions prompt)

2. Just enter your question in the box.

Some phones will encounter text pop-ups. Please use Siri to run the shortcut again, and click Allow all the way until an error is reported. Turn on SmarT Siri again from Shortcuts to use it normally! ! !
